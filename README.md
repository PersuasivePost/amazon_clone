This project is a clone of Amazon.com, created using only basic HTML and CSS. 
It showcases the structure and layout of the Amazon homepage, including key sections such as the header, search bar, navigation menu, product listings, and footer. 
This project was developed to practice and demonstrate skills in HTML and CSS by replicating a well-known e-commerce website.
Thank You :)
